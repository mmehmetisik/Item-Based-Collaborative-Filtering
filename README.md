# Item-Based-Collaborative-Filtering

# Business Problem
- An online film viewing platform wants to develop a recommendation system with collaborative filtering.
  The company, which is experimenting with content-based recommendation systems, wants to develop recommendations in a way to accommodate the opinions of the community.
- When users like a film, they want to recommend other films that have a similar liking pattern with that film.

# Dataset Story

      - movield: Unique film number
      - title: Film name

      - movield = Unique film number
      - rating = Rating given to the film by the user
